### Description
"Brain Games" is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions to which to give the right answers. After three correct answers it is considered that the game has passed. Wrong answers finish the game and offer to pass it again. 

Games:
- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated.
- Progression. Search for missed numbers in a number sequence.
- Determining an even number.
- Determining the greatest common divisor.
- Determining the prime number.
